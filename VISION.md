Qode: Democratizing Queue Management
The Core Concept: "The Phone is the Queue"
In the modern world, everyone carries a smartphone, yet we still rely on an archaic method for service: standing in a physical line. Qode aims to shift the burden of "waiting" from the person's legs to their digital device.

The philosophy is simple: If you have a phone, you shouldn't have to stand in line.

The Landscape
Virtual queuing is not new, but it is currently gated behind high costs and complex infrastructure:

Hospitals & Clinics: Use expensive enterprise hardware and proprietary software.

Theme Parks: Major parks use complex app-based systems requiring heavy development.

Government Offices: Rely on inflexible pre-booking systems.

The Gap: The "Little Guy"
Small and dynamic environments are left behind:

Anime Conventions & Expos: Popular booths have massive lines blocking hallways.

Street Food & Pop-ups: High-demand trucks lose customers due to visible long lines.

Temporary Events: Meet-and-greets or registration desks.

The Mission
Qode focuses on Accessible Queue Management:

Zero Hardware: Only the smartphone.

Zero Friction: No app store downloads. No registration. Just scan and wait.

Dynamic Deployment: Set up in seconds.
